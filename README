hgsubversion
============

hgsubversion is an extension for Mercurial that allows using Mercurial
as a Subversion client.

At this point, hgsubversion is usable by users reasonably familiar with
Mercurial as a VCS. It's not recommended to dive into hgsubversion as an
introduction to Mercurial, since hgsubversion "bends the rules" a little
and violates some of the typical assumptions of early Mercurial users.

Installation
------------
You need to have Subversion installed with the SWIG Python bindings
from Subversion 1.5 or later. You need Mercurial 1.3 or later.

.. _mercurial: http://selenic.com/repo/hg
.. _mercurial-stable: http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable
.. _crew: http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew
.. _crew-stable: http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew-stable

If you are unfamiliar with installing Mercurial extensions, please see
the UsingExtensions_ page in the Mercurial wiki. Look at the example
for specifying an absolute path near the bottom of the page. You want
to give the path to the top level of your clone of this repository.

Before using hgsubversion, I *strongly* encourage you to run the
automated tests. Just use nose_ if you have it (or ``easy_install
nose`` if you want it), or use ``python tests/run.py`` to run the
suite with the conventional test runner. Note that because I use nose,
there's a lot of stdout spew in the tests right now. The important
part is that all the tests pass.

Basic Use
-----------
Get a new clone of an svn server::

 $ hg clone <svn URI> [destination]

Real example::

 $ hg clone http://python-nose.googlecode.com/svn nose-hg

Note, you should pull from the root subversion directory, not specific
folders (such as trunk).

Pull new revisions into an already-converted repo::

 $ hg pull

For more information, see ``hg help svn`` while in a converted repo.

Support for ``svn:externals``
-----------------------------
All ``svn:externals`` properties are serialized into a single
``.hgsvnexternals`` file, with the following syntax::

  [.]
   external_reference_line1_1
   external_reference_line1_2
  [dir2]
   external_reference_line2_1
   external_reference_line2_2

A header line gives the directory the property applies on, '.' for the
project root directory. The property content follows, *every line
being prefixed by a single space*.

The creation or modification of this file will trigger ``svn:externals``
updates on the related subversion repository.
